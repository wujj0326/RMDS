# 2019 RMDS Data Science Competition

To create a statistical model to predict tropical cyclone (TC) intensity change in 24 hours

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Python 3

### Installing Packages

numpy
pandas
sklearn
matplotlib
seaborn
xarray
scipy
imblearn
netcdf4

## Running the tests

Run all the functions that we have defined in the code first.
Load and clean the data by using the functions.
Run all the models to look at the confusion metrix and POD, FAR and PSS.
Predict the test data by using our best model - Random Forest.

### Break down into end to end tests

After some presettings of the datasets, we are able to test the PSS scores on the different models. The highest PSS score we could get is 0.99, from the random forest model.
